# Using the Alicloud provider extension with Gardener as end-user

The [`core.gardener.cloud/v1beta1.Shoot` resource](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/example/90-shoot.yaml) declares a few fields that are meant to contain provider-specific configuration.

This document describes the configurable options for Alicloud and provides an example `Shoot` manifest with minimal configuration that can be used to create an Alicloud cluster (modulo the landscape-specific information like cloud profile names, secret binding names, etc.).

## Alicloud Provider Credentials

In order for Gardener to create a Kubernetes cluster using Alicloud infrastructure components, a Shoot has to provide credentials with sufficient permissions to the desired Alicloud project.
Every shoot cluster references a `SecretBinding` which itself references a `Secret`, and this `Secret` contains the provider credentials of the Alicloud project.

This `Secret` must look as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: core-alicloud
  namespace: garden-dev
type: Opaque
data:
  accessKeyID: base64(access-key-id)
  accessKeySecret: base64(access-key-secret)
```

The `SecretBinding` is configurable in the [Shoot cluster](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/example/90-shoot.yaml) with the field `secretBindingName`.

The required credentials for the Alicloud project are an [AccessKey Pair](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/29009.htm) associated with a [Resource Access Management (RAM) User](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/28627.htm).
A RAM user is a special account that can be used by services and applications to interact with Alicloud Cloud Platform APIs.
Applications can use AccessKey pair to authorize themselves to a set of APIs and perform actions within the permissions granted to the RAM user.

Make sure to [create a Resource Access Management User](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/93720.htm), and [create an AccessKey Pair](https://partners-intl.aliyun.com/help/doc-detail/116401.htm) that shall be used for the Shoot cluster.

### Permissions

Please make sure the provided credentials have the correct privileges. You can use the following Alicloud RAM policy document and attach it to the RAM user backed by the credentials you provided.

              "Resource": [
                  "*"

          },
          {
              "Action": [
                  "ecs:*"

          {

                  "ram:GetRole",
                  "ram:CreateRole",

          {
              "Action": [
                  "ros:*"
              ],
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Resource": [
                  "*"
              ]
          }
      ],
      "Version": "1"
  }
  ```
</details>

## `InfrastructureConfig`

The infrastructure configuration mainly describes how the network layout looks like in order to create the shoot worker nodes in a later step, thus, prepares everything relevant to create VMs, load balancers, volumes, etc.

An example `InfrastructureConfig` for the Alicloud extension looks as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: alicloud.provider.extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1
kind: InfrastructureConfig
networks:
  vpc: # specify either 'id' or 'cidr'
  # id: my-vpc
    cidr: 10.250.0.0/16
  # gardenerManagedNATGateway: true
  zones:
  - name: eu-central-1a
    workers: 10.250.1.0/24
  # natGateway:
    # eipAllocationID: eip-ufxsdg122elmszcg
```

The `networks.vpc` section describes whether you want to create the shoot cluster in an already existing VPC or whether to create a new one:

* If `networks.vpc.id` is given then you have to specify the VPC ID of the existing VPC that was created by other means (manually, other tooling, ...).
* If `networks.vpc.cidr` is given then you have to specify the VPC CIDR of a new VPC that will be created during shoot creation.
You can freely choose a private CIDR range.
* Either `networks.vpc.id` or `networks.vpc.cidr` must be present, but not both at the same time.
* When `networks.vpc.id` is present, in addition, you can also choose to set `networks.vpc.gardenerManagedNATGateway`. It is by default `false`. When it is set to `true`,
Gardener will create an Enhanced NATGateway in the VPC and associate it with a VSwitch created in the first zone in the `networks.zones`.
* Please note that when `networks.vpc.id` is present, and `networks.vpc.gardenerManagedNATGateway` is `false` or not set, you have to **manually** create an Enhance NATGateway
and associate it with a VSwitch that you **manually** created. In this case, make sure the worker CIDRs in `networks.zones` do not overlap with the one you created.
If a NATGateway is created manually and a shoot is created in the same VPC with `networks.vpc.gardenerManagedNATGateway` set `true`, you need to manually adjust the route rule accordingly.
You may refer to [here](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/doc-detail/121139.html).

The `networks.zones` section describes which subnets you want to create in availability zones.
For every zone, the Alicloud extension creates one subnet:

* The `workers` subnet is used for all shoot worker nodes, i.e., VMs which later run your applications.

For every subnet, you have to specify a CIDR range contained in the VPC CIDR specified above, or the VPC CIDR of your already existing VPC.
You can freely choose these CIDR and it is your responsibility to properly design the network layout to suit your needs.

If you want to use multiple availability zones then add a second, third, ... entry to the `networks.zones[]` list and properly specify the AZ name in `networks.zones[].name`.

Apart from the VPC and the subnets the Alicloud extension will also create a NAT gateway (only if a new VPC is created), a key pair, elastic IPs, VSwitches, a SNAT table entry, and security groups.

By default, the Alicloud extension will create a corresponding Elastic IP that it attaches to this NAT gateway and which is used for egress traffic.
The `networks.zones[].natGateway.eipAllocationID` field allows you to specify the Elastic IP Allocation ID of an existing Elastic IP allocation in case you want to bring your own.
If provided, no new Elastic IP will be created and, instead, the Elastic IP specified by you will be used.

⚠️ If you change this field for an already existing infrastructure then it will disrupt egress traffic while Alicloud applies this change, because the NAT gateway must be recreated with the new Elastic IP association.
Also, please note that the existing Elastic IP will be permanently deleted if it was earlier created by the Alicloud extension.

## `ControlPlaneConfig`

The control plane configuration mainly contains values for the Alicloud-specific control plane components.
Today, the Alicloud extension deploys the `cloud-controller-manager` and the CSI controllers.

An example `ControlPlaneConfig` for the Alicloud extension looks as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: alicloud.provider.extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1
kind: ControlPlaneConfig
csi:
  enableADController: true
cloudControllerManager:
  featureGates:
    RotateKubeletServerCertificate: true
```
The `csi.enableADController` is used as the value of environment [DISK_AD_CONTROLLER](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/alibaba-cloud-csi-driver/blob/cd0788a0a440926d504d8f8fb7f6e738fe96f3ae/pkg/disk/nodeserver.go#L80), which is used for AliCloud csi-disk-plugin. This field is optional. When a new shoot is creatd, this field is automatically set true. For an existing shoot created in previous versions, it remains unchanged. If there are persistent volumes created before year 2021, please be cautious to set this field _true_ because they may fail to mount to nodes.

The `cloudControllerManager.featureGates` contains a map of explicitly enabled or disabled feature gates.
For production usage it's not recommend to use this field at all as you can enable alpha features or disable beta/stable features, potentially impacting the cluster stability.
If you don't want to configure anything for the `cloudControllerManager` simply omit the key in the YAML specification.

## `WorkerConfig`

The Alicloud extension does not support a specific `WorkerConfig`. However, it supports additional data volumes (plus encryption) per machine.
By default (if not stated otherwise), all the disks are unencrypted.
For each data volume, you have to specify a name.
It also supports encrypted system disk.
However, only [Customized image](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/172789.htm?spm=a2c63.l28256.b99.244.5da67453bNBrCt) is currently supported to be used as a basic image for encrypted system disk.
Please be noted that the change of system disk encryption flag will cause reconciliation of a shoot, and it will result in nodes rolling update within the worker group.

The following YAML is a snippet of a `Shoot` resource:

```yaml
spec:
  provider:
    workers:
    - name: cpu-worker
      ...
      volume:
        type: cloud_efficiency
        size: 20Gi
        encrypted: true
      dataVolumes:
      - name: kubelet-dir
        type: cloud_efficiency
        size: 25Gi
        encrypted: true
```
